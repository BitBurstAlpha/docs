## Adding Knowledge to your chatbot

By default, a newly created chatbot does not have any knowledge.
So in order to make your chatbot smart, we need to teach it first.

Start by adding the knowledge sources you need.
You can use a website, YouTube video, documents, or custom FAQs as knowledge sources.

Once you have added and trained your knowledge, you can add it to your chatbot:
- Select the chatbot to which you want to add knowledge.
- Go to the chatbot configuration page by clicking on the chatbot name.

- Select the knowledge you want to add for this particular chatbot and click on add knowledge.
