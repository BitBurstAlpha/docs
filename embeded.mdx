title: "Embedding in your app"
description: "Embedding the ticket system in your app is similar to adding the Chatbot using the low-code solution.We can embed the ticket elements using either HTML or React."
---

Specifically, we need to add two elements:
- The form to create a ticket
- A table showing the tickets

# Create a ticket form
The form to create a ticket is a simple HTML and React form that can be added to your app.

To create a ticket, we need to add the CreateTicket(specify as component) component.

<CodeGroup>

```html HTML
<script async type="text/javascript" src="https://client.lexi.ai/create-ticket.ab.js"></script>
 
<ab-create-ticket ticketFormID="YOUR-TICKET-FORM-ID" userID="USER-ID">
  <button>Create ticket</button>
</ab-create-ticket>
```

```javascript React
import { CreateTicket } from '@lexi/create-ticket';
 
<CreateTicket ticketFormID="YOUR-TICKET-FORM-ID" userID="USER-ID">
  <button>Create ticket</button>
</CreateTicket>
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>You can find the Ticket Form ID in the Ticket Form settings under the Settings tab.</Note>

# Display tickets ina table
To display the tickets in a table, we need to add the `<ab-tickets-table></ab-tickets-table>` element.

<CodeGroup>
```html HTML
<script async type="text/javascript" src="https://client.lexi.ai/tickets-table.ab.js"></script>
 
<ab-tickets-table ticketFormID="YOUR-TICKET-FORM-ID" userID="USER-ID"></ab-tickets-table>
```

```javascript React
import { TicketsTable } from '@lexi/tickets-table';
 
<TicketsTable ticketFormID="YOUR-TICKET-FORM-ID" userID="USER-ID" />
```

</CodeGroup>

This will render a table showing the tickets for the user with the ID USER-ID.

If you want to only display tickets with a specific status, you can include these statuses using the status attribute.

```javascript React
import { TicketsTable } from '@aidbase/tickets-table';
 
<TicketsTable
  ticketFormID="YOUR-TICKET-FORM-ID"
  userID="USER-ID"
  status="OPEN,ASSIGNED,NEED_MORE_INFO"
/>
```

# Display a single ticket
To display a single ticket, we need to add the `<ab-ticket></ab-ticket>` element.
<CodeGroup>

```html HTML
<script async type="text/javascript" src="https://client.aidbase.ai/ticket.ab.js"></script>
 
<ab-ticket ticketFormID="YOUR-TICKET-FORM-ID" ticketID="TICKET-ID">
  <button>Open ticket</button>
</ab-ticket>
```

```javascript React
import { Ticket } from '@lexi/ticket';
 
<Ticket ticketFormID="YOUR-TICKET-FORM-ID" ticketID="TICKET-ID">
  <button>Open ticket</button>
</Ticket>
```

</CodeGroup>

The TICKET-ID should be the ID of the ticket you want to display.
This ID can be found in on the Tickets page in the LEXI Dashboard for a given ticket.

It can also be retrieved through the payload of a webhook.

# Additional user information
In addition to the userID, you can also include username, email and profileImageURL.
We recommend including as many of them as you have available.

<CodeGroup>

```html HTML
<ab-tickets-table
  ticketFormID="YOUR-TICKET-FORM-ID"
  userID="USER-ID"
  username="John Doe"
  email="john@doe.com"
  profileImageURL="https://example.com/profile-image.png"
></ab-tickets-table>
```

```javascript React
<TicketsTable
  ticketFormID="YOUR-TICKET-FORM-ID"
  userID="USER-ID"
  username="John Doe"
  email="john@doe.com"
  profileImageURL="https://example.com/profile-image.png"
/>
```
