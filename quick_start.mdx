This is the easiest way to get started.  
Copy the following code snippet and add it in the `<head>` section of all pages where your Chatbot should be displayed.

```javascript HTML
<script>
  AIDBASE_CHATBOT_ID = 'YOUR-CHATBOT-ID';
</script>
<script async type="text/javascript" src="https://client.aidbase.ai/chat.ab.js"></script>
```
Replace `YOUR-CHATBOT-ID` with the ID of your Chatbot.

<Tip>You can find the Chatbot ID in the Chatbot settings under the Settings tab.</Tip>

That's all ðŸ¥³
Your Chatbot is now installed and ready to use.
